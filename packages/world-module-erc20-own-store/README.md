# Standalone ERC20 Module with own Store

This is an `ERC20` token template that is compatible with the MUD framework. The logic of the token contract is near native and resides within the token contract, while its storage makes use of `Store` and is reflected in corresponding tables.

The `OpenZeppelin` implementation of ERC20 is used as reference but tests are written in `Solidity`.
